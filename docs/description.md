The REST API of the Marketplace works using the HTTP protocol. When accessing the marketplace, the program returns a response in JSON format. The marketplay works directly with Unique and Kusama blockchain networks through the WebSocket protocol.

All requests are generated through the [Unique SDK](https:www.npmjs.compackage@unique-nftsdk) package. All transactions are performed on a batch basis.
You can see the full documentation for the Unique SDK here: [Github Unique SDK](https://github.com/UniqueNetwork/unique-sdk)
