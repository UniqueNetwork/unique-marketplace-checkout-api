## Who is this document for:

- Full stack engineers
- IT administrators

> This is a tutorial about how to perform an install of the marketplace backend locally on a computer or in a virtual machine with Ubuntu OS.

## Prerequisites

- OS: Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04
- docker CE 20.10 or up
- docker-compose 1.25 or up
- git

**Warning**:  You are encouraged to change the insecure default credentials and check out the available configuration options in the [Environment Variables](#environmentvariables) section for a more secure deployment.

## How to use

Marketplace Backend is divided into 3 containers: `marketplace-api` which is the main REST API and
two auxiliary workers `marketplace-escrow-unique` and `marketplace-escrow-kusama` which requires access to a PostgreSQL database to store information. This assembly can be built using [Unique-Marketplace-Api GitHub Repository](https:github.comUniqueNetworkunique-marketplace-api.git) or take images [UniqueNetwork Docker Hub Image](https:hub.docker.comruniquenetworkmarketplace-backend) with instructions for deployment.

### Run the application using Docker Compose

The main folder of this repository contains a functional [`docker-compose.example.yml`](https://github.com/UniqueNetwork/unique-marketplace-api/blob/release/v1.0/docker-compose.example.yml) file.
All settings based on env variables and listed in `docker-compose.example.yml` file. To setup the initial docker-compose config file, make a copy of the example file renaming it to `docker-compose.yml`. Tweak the settings and run the service.

Run the application using using these commands:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/UniqueNetwork/unique-marketplace-api.git
$ cd unique-marketplace-api
```
### Using the Docker Command Line

The application can be also run manually instead of using `docker-compose`. To do so follow these steps:

### Step 1: Setup the environment

```shell
$ cp docker-compose.example.yml  docker-compose.yml
```

```shell
$ vi docker-compose.yml
```
or

```shell
$ nano docker-compose.yml
```

 - Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file and specify all settings for the environment, except for the two items `CONTRACT_ETH_OWNER_SEED` and `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` - this data will become available in step 4.
 - Change ESCROW_SEED to the 12-word admin mnemonic seed phrase of the market admin account address from the Polkadot{.js} browser wallet extension.
 - Carefully review all settings for the environment and follow the instructions.


### Step 2: Start the main container

```shell
$ docker-compose up -d  marketplace-api
```

### Step 3: Migration database

```shell
$ docker exec marketplace-api npm run migration:run
```

### Step 4: Deploy Smart Contract

```shell
$ docker exec marketplace-api node dist/cli.js deploy contract
```
After a short span of time you will see a terminal output similar to the example below:

```shell
...

SUMMARY:

CONTRACT_ETH_OWNER_SEED: '0x6d853337ab45b20aa5231c33979330e2806465fb4ab...'
CONTRACT_ADDRESS: '0x74C2d83b868f7E7B7C02B7D0b87C3532a06f392c'
```

### Step 5: Add smart contract data to `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
   ...
   ESCROW_SEED: '//Alice'
   AUCTION_SEED: '//Bob'
   BULK_SALE_SEED: '//Eve'
   MARKET_TYPE: 'secondary'
   ADMIN_LIST: ''
   UNIQUE_WS_ENDPOINT: 'wss://opal.unique.network'
   UNIQUE_NETWORK: 'opal'
   UNIQUE_START_FROM_BLOCK: 'current'
#    CONTRACT_ETH_OWNER_SEED: 'Get by running "npm run playground deploy_contract"'
#    CONTRACT_ADDRESS: 'Get by running "npm run playground deploy_contract"'
   UNIQUE_COLLECTION_IDS: '1, 2, 3'
   ...
```
> CONTRACT_ETH_OWNER_SEED - long token, dots added at the end as an example

 change to:
```yaml
   ...
   UNIQUE_WS_ENDPOINT: 'wss://opal.unique.network'
   UNIQUE_NETWORK: 'opal'
   UNIQUE_START_FROM_BLOCK: 'current'
   CONTRACT_ETH_OWNER_SEED: '0x6d853337ab45b20aa5231c33979330e2806465fb4ab...'
   CONTRACT_ADDRESS: '0x74C2d83b868f7E7B7C02B7D0b87C3532a06f392c'
   UNIQUE_COLLECTION_IDS: '1, 2, 3'
   ...
```
### Step 6: Start api container

```shell
$ docker-compose up -d marketplace-api
```
### Step 7: Сheck installation

An installation check can be performed by running:

```shell
$ docker exec marketplace-api node dist/cli.js checkconfig
```
If everything is configured correctly, you will see a bunch of green checkboxes in the console, as shown below:

```markdown
Checking CONTRACT_ADDRESS
  [v] Contract address valid: 0x3c9931eA16D1048D7e22F3630844EC25eFD6B26f
  [v] Contract balance is 40 tokens (40000000000000000000)
  [v] Contract self-sponsoring is enabled
  [v] Rate limit is zero blocks
  [v] Contract owner valid, owner address: 0x3CA7393F1C8Df383c0f35d7BC1a5a938168c7d4b
Contract owner balance is 4 tokens (4492008910681246304)

Checking UNIQUE_COLLECTION_IDS
Collection #3
  [v] Sponsor is confirmed, yGGxcBQUCymdHtjQUdJDiXDTTXuonGv8HyRJiH5YDUcmfUyhr
  [v] Sponsor has 999999999948 tokens (999999999948126753000000000000) on its substrate wallet
  [v] Sponsor has 1000000000 tokens (1000000000000000000000000000) on its ethereum wallet
  [v] Transfer timeout is zero blocks
  [v] Approve timeout is zero blocks
```
At this point, the setup is almost done.


### Step 8: Start all containers

Execute the following command in the terminal and wait for it to complete:

```shell
$ docker-compose up -d
```

### Check running application

```shell
$ curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://localhost:5000/api/system/health' \
  -H 'accept: */*'
```
Response JSON:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "info": {
    "App": {
      "status": "up"
    },
    "OffersHealthIndicator": {
      "status": "up"
    },
    "TradesHealthIndicator": {

## Configuration


### Environment variables

When an UniqueNetwork Marketplace Backend container is started, the configuration of the instance can be adjusted by passing one or more environment variables either on the docker-compose file or on the `docker run` command line.
Should there arise a need to add a new environment variable:

### Running database migrations

Migrations can start automatically by setting AUTO_DB_MIGRATIONS env to true, or manually by executing 'npm run playground migrate_db' (highly recommended).

- For docker-compose add the variable name and value under the application section in the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/UniqueNetwork/unique-marketplace-api/blob/master/docker-compose.hub.yml) file present in this repository:

```yaml
...
    x-marketplace: &marketplace-backend
    ...
    environment:
      POSTGRES_URL: 'postgres://marketplace:12345@marketplace-postgres:5432/marketplace_db'
      API_PORT: '5000'
      DISABLE_SECURITY: 'false'
      ...
```
```yaml
...
  marketplace-postgres:
      ...
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: 'marketplace_db'
      POSTGRES_USER: 'marketplace'

```shell
$ docker pull uniquenetwork/marketplace-backend:latest
```
To use a specific version, pull a versioned tag. You can view the [list of available versions](https://hub.docker.com/r/uniquenetwork/marketplace-backend/tags/) in the Docker Hub Registry.

```shell
$ docker pull uniquenetwork/marketplace-backend:[TAG]
```

An image can be built by issung the following command:

```shell
$ docker build -t uniquenetwork/marketplace-backend:latest 'https://github.com/UniqueNetwork/unique-marketplace-api.git'
```
## How to use this image

Marketplace Backend requires access to a PostgreSQL database to store information.

### Run the application using Docker Compose

The main folder of this repository contains a functional [`docker-compose.example.yml`](https://github.com/UniqueNetwork/unique-marketplace-api/blob/release/v1.0/docker-compose.example.yml) file.
All settings based on env variables and listed in `docker-compose.example.yml` file. To setup the initial docker-compose config file, make a copy of the example file renaming it to `docker-compose.yml`. Tweak the settings and run the service.

Run the application using using these commands:

```shell
$ curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UniqueNetwork/unique-marketplace-api/master/docker-compose.hub.yml > docker-compose.yml
```
### Using the Docker Command Line

The application can be also run manually instead of using `docker-compose`. To do so follow these steps:

#### Step One: Setup the environment
- Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file and specify all settings for the environment, except for the two items `CONTRACT_ETH_OWNER_SEED` and `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` - this data will become available in step 4.
- Change ESCROW_SEED to the 12-word admin mnemonic seed phrase of the market admin account address from the Polkadot{.js} browser wallet extension.

#### Step Two: Use the settings step 2

Go to [Step 2: Start the main container](#step-2-start-the-main-container)

### Prometheus metric connection

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/) collects and stores its metrics as time series data, i.e. metrics information is stored with the timestamp at which it was recorded, alongside optional key-value pairs called labels.

<summary> Running a container with Prometheus (expand)</summary>


#### Step 1: Get `docker-compose.prometheus.yml`

```shell
$ curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UniqueNetwork/unique-marketplace-api/master/docker-compose.prometheus.yml > docker-compose.prometheus.yml
```

#### Step 2: Run docker-compose

```shell
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.prometheus.yml up -d
```

#### Step 3: Open in browser

Local configuration

> http://localhost:9090/metrics

In case you configured it via Nginx

> https://youdomain.com/metrics


### Using the expression browser
Let us try looking at some data that Prometheus has collected about itself. To use Prometheus's built-in expression browser, navigate to http://localhost:9090/graph and choose the "Table" view within the "Graph" tab.
As one can gather from http://localhost:9090/metrics, one of the metric data that Prometheus exports about itself is called promhttp_metric_handler_requests_total (the total number of /metrics requests the Prometheus server has served). Go ahead and enter this into the expression console:
